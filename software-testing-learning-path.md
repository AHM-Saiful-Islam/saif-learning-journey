# Software Testing

This document outlines key concepts, Target outcomes, and core topics in **Software Testing**. It is designed as a GitHub post to help learners and practitioners build structured knowledge of testing techniques, strategies, and tools.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Outcomes

You must be able to:

* **O1.** Analyze requirements to determine appropriate testing strategies.
* **O2.** Design and implement comprehensive test plans with instrumented code.
* **O3.** Apply a wide variety of testing techniques and compute test coverage and yield according to a variety of criteria.
* **O4.** Evaluate the limitations of a given testing process, using statistical methods where appropriate, and summarise outcomes.
* **O5.** Conduct reviews and inspections and design and implement automated testing processes.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics should be covered

### 1. Testing Techniques and Principles

* **Defects vs. Failures**: A **defect** is a flaw in the system, while a **failure** is the manifestation of a defect when the software does not behave as expected.
* **Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP)**: Dividing input data into valid and invalid classes to minimize test cases.
* **Boundary Value Testing (BVT)**: Testing values at, just below, and just above the boundaries.

---

### 2. Types of Defects

* **Functional Defects**: Incorrect or missing functionality.
* **Performance Defects**: System runs slow or fails under load.
* **Usability Defects**: Poor user experience.
* **Compatibility Defects**: Issues across browsers, OS, or devices.

---

### 3. Black-Box vs. Structural Testing

* **Black-Box Testing**: Focuses on input/output without knowledge of internal code.
* **Structural (White-Box) Testing**: Tests designed based on internal code structure.

---

### 4. Testing Strategies

* **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions or modules (e.g., JUnit for Java).
* **Integration Testing**: Ensures modules interact correctly.
* **Profiling**: Analyzing performance hotspots.
* **Test Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before implementing code.

### 5. State-Based, Configuration, and Compatibility Testing

* **State-Based Testing**: Validates system behavior under different states.
* **Configuration Testing**: Verifies performance under different configurations (OS, DB, network).
* **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures functionality across devices/browsers.

---

### 6. Alpha, Beta, and Acceptance Testing

* **Alpha Testing**: Internal testing by developers/QA before external release.
* **Beta Testing**: Released to limited external users for feedback.
* **Acceptance Testing**: Validates the system against business requirements.

---

### 7. Coverage Criteria

* **Line Coverage**: Each line executed.
* **Statement Coverage**: Each statement executed.
* **Branch Coverage**: Each decision outcome executed.
* **Condition Coverage**: Each boolean condition tested.
* **Path Coverage**: Each path through code tested.
* **MC/DC**: Each condition independently affects decision outcomes.

### 8. Test Instrumentation and Tools

* Instrumentation inserts extra code for measuring execution.
* Popular tools:

  * **JaCoCo** (Java)
  * **Istanbul** (JavaScript)
  * **Coverage.py** (Python)

### 9. Developing Test Plans

A **test plan** includes:

* Test objectives
* Scope and features to test
* Test cases and expected results
* Tools required
* Roles and responsibilities

### 10. Managing the Testing Process: Development Lifecycles

* Testing must align with **SDLC models**:

  * Waterfall
  * V-Model
  * Agile (Scrum, Kanban)
  * DevOps (continuous testing)

---

### 11. Problem Reporting, Tracking, and Analysis

* Defects tracked using tools like **Jira**, **Bugzilla**, or **Azure DevOps**.
* A good bug report includes:

  * Summary
  * Steps to reproduce
  * Expected vs. actual results
  * Environment details
